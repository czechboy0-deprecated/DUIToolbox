iOS UIKit Toolbox

Created by Honza Dvorsky - http://honzadvorsky.com

The DUIToolbox is a mini library of classes useful for iOS UIKit developers.

### Constraint Factory
This class provides shortcuts for creating the most common autolayout constraints. If you find that there are some common usecases missing, please let me know and I'll be happy to add them.

### Other classes
Are documented in their header files.

## Installation

DUIToolbox is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "DUIToolbox"

## Demo project

You can find a demo project in the Project folder. But don't forget to run `pod install` before building it, so that the project can use the library!
